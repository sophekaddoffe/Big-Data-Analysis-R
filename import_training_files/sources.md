# Data Sources

The "books.tsv" and "books.txt" data sets were obtained from the New York Times using their Books API and the `jsonlite` R package. "publishers_with_places.xlsx" was then deducted from this (and its non-fiction complementary): the unique publishers were extracted and their respective places manually added.

"ches_2017_modified.csv" was downloaded from the CHES homepage (https://www.chesdata.eu) and then modified using `dplyr`.

"speeches.csv" contains speeches which were held in the Swedish parliament (Riksdagen). The data were collected by MÃ¥ns Magnusson on the official Riksdagen homepage, cleaned, and can be downloaded from his GitHub Repo (<https://www.github.com/MansMeg/rcrpsriksdag>).

"spotify2018.csv" contains the 100 most-played songs on Spotify in 2018. It was downloaded from Kaggle (<https://www.kaggle.com/nadintamer7top-spotify-tracks-of-2018>)
